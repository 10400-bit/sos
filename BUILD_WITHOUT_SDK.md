# 📱 Build APK Without Android SDK (Alternative Methods)

Since setting up Android SDK can be time-consuming, here are alternatives:

## 🚀 Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Free & Automatic)

I can create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds your APK automatically in the cloud - no Android SDK needed on your computer!

**Steps:**
1. Create a GitHub account (free)
2. Create a new repository
3. Upload your project
4. I'll create the workflow file
5. APK builds automatically in the cloud
6. Download the APK when done

## 🌐 Option 2: Online Build Services

### Codemagic (Recommended)
- **Free tier:** 500 build minutes/month
- **URL:** https://codemagic.io
- **Steps:**
  1. Sign up (free)
  2. Connect GitHub or upload project
  3. Select Flutter project
  4. Click "Start new build"
  5. Download APK when done

### AppCircle
- **Free tier available**
- **URL:** https://appcircle.io
- Similar process to Codemagic

## 💻 Option 3: Use a Different Computer

If you have access to another computer with Android Studio:
1. Copy the entire project folder
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Click "Build" → "Build APK"
4. APK will be in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

## 📦 Option 4: Pre-built APK (If I Had Access)

Unfortunately, I cannot directly build APK files because:
- I don't have access to Android SDK
- I can't execute Flutter build commands
- APK files are binary and require compilation

## ✅ Recommended: GitHub Actions

This is the easiest long-term solution. Would you like me to:
1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file?
2. Guide you through setting it up?
3. Your APK will build automatically on every push!

Let me know which option you prefer!
